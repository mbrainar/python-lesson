## Python Syntax

### Indentation

Python was designed to be easily human readable. One of the ways in which this 
is accomplished is through the use of indentation. When writing Python code 
there are sections where some code is meant to be executed as a block; Python 
relies on indentation instead of explicit delimiters, for example `{ }`. 
Python doesn't care what your indentation is 
[tabs or spaces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoOG6ZeyUI) but it has to be 
consistent throughout the code. If your indentation doesn't match, you will see 
an error that looks like 
`IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level`
Here is a sample code block using indentation:

```
if name == "Matthew":
    print "Hello", name
```

### Reserved Words

Python has reserved words; words that cannot be used as variable, object, 
or function names.
